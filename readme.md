# What it's supposed to do
This program is supposed to check Ada-1's daily inventory,
compare it against my inventory, and then send me an email
whether there's something new to buy or not. This wouldn't
usually be a problem but I'm bad at checking the app so I 
want it to be sent to me as a push notification on my phone
shut up.
